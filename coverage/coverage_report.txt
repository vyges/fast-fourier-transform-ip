Test Coverage Summary:
====================

Test Files Executed:
- test_fft_basic.py (5 tests)
- test_fft_rescaling.py (3 tests) 
- test_fft_edge_cases.py (8 tests)

Total Tests: 16

Coverage Areas Tested:
- Basic FFT functionality (1024-point FFT)
- Rescaling and overflow detection
- Edge cases and boundary conditions
- APB interface testing
- Memory interface testing
- Performance testing
- Error handling and interrupts

Test Results:
- All tests completed successfully
- Icarus Verilog simulation passed
- No test failures reported

Coverage Limitations:
- Icarus Verilog has limited coverage collection capabilities
- Coverage data not available in standard formats
- Tests provide functional verification but not line coverage

Recommendations:
- Use Verilator for more detailed coverage analysis
- Consider adding coverage assertions in test code
- Implement coverage collection in testbench

Repository: vyges/fast-fourier-transform-ip
Run ID: 16684081568

Test Files:
- test_fft_basic.py (4 tests)
- test_fft_rescaling.py (5 tests) 
- test_fft_edge_cases.py (8 tests)

Total Tests: 17+

Coverage Areas:
- Basic FFT functionality (1024-point computation, APB interface)
- Rescaling and overflow detection (multiple modes, thresholds)
- Edge cases and boundary conditions (zero input, impulse, max magnitude)
- Different FFT sizes (64, 128, 256, 512, 1024 points)
- Invalid configuration handling
- Concurrent operations and bus contention
- Memory boundary conditions
- Clock frequency variations
- Interrupt generation and handling
- Performance measurement and timing

Test Status: 
- Verilator: Attempted (may fail due to cocotb linking issues)
- Icarus: Attempted (should work correctly)
- Coverage: Enabled for Icarus tests

Note: Verilator tests may fail due to known cocotb linking issues.
Icarus Verilog tests should work correctly and provide full coverage.
